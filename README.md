Requirements:

* build a page that shows pictures using an image feed.
* try to keep cross compatibility for Chrome, Firefox, IE9 to IE11 and Safari in mind.
* adding tests to your JS code is encouraged.


Users should be able to:

* toggle their favourites photos by clicking on them, add a `is-selected` class to the `img` element when selected
* deselect a selected photo by clicking on it
* reload the page, the previously selected pictures should be remembered


You have complete freedom to choose whatever library/framework you want to use (both JS and CSS). The use of JQuery is discouraged.
